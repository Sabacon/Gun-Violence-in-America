### Gun-Violence-in-America

I decided to analyze shootings in the States having stumbled on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nidzsharma/us-mass-shootings-19822023) dataset on Kaggle. 

A single notebook would have been a bit long so I chose to clean the data in one notebook and do the analysis in a separate one. Both are clearly-labeled and available in this repository.

I went a step further and built an interactive dashboard using Tableau. [Here it is.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brian.sabacon/viz/USShootings1982-2023/Dashboard1)
