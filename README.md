### Gun-Violence-in-America

I decided to analyze shootings in the States having stumbled on [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nidzsharma/us-mass-shootings-19822023) dataset on Kaggle. 

A single notebook would have been a bit long so I chose to clean the data in one notebook and do the analysis in a separate one. Both are clearly-labeled and available in this repository.

I went a step further and built an interactive dashboard using Tableau. [Here it is.](https://public.tableau.com/shared/QFW7WWX34?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
